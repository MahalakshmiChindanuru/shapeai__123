      <p>
        The Bootcamp that was conducted by SHAPEAI regarding javascript and
        react.js is really wonderful and it is hosted by Shaurya Sinha. Before
        this i dont have any idea about javascript and react.js,this bootcamp
        helped me a lot. He is such a good teaching person i have ever seen,he
        inspired me to be a better person. This kind of bootcamps are very
        helpful for students so we expect more bootcamps from SHAPEAI. I'm very
        excited to attend this kind of bootcamps more and more. Thanking You for
        giving this amazing opportunity
